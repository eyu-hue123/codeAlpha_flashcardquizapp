2. How to Recognize Phishing Emails
- Generic Greetings: Emails starting with "Dear user" or "Valued customer" instead of your name.
- Urgency: Messages that create a sense of panic, such as "Act now or your account will be closed."
- Suspicious Links: Hover over links to check if the URL matches the sender's domain.
- Attachments: Be cautious of unexpected attachments, especially with file extensions like .exe, .scr, or .js.

- Domain Typos: Attackers often use slightly altered domain names, such as amaz0n.com instead of amazon.com.
- Unsecured Sites: Legitimate websites use HTTPS (look for the padlock symbol in the browser).
- Poor Design: Fake websites often have low-quality logos, mismatched fonts, or broken layouts.
- Pop-Up Login Forms: Legitimate websites rarely use pop-ups for login credentials.
